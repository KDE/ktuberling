<P>KTuberling is a game intended for small children. Of course, it may be suitable
for adults who have remained young at heart.
<P>It is a potato editor. That means that you can drag and drop eyes, mouths, moustache,
and other parts of face and goodies onto a potato-like guy.
<P>There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the funniest faces you can.
<P>There is a museum (like a "Madame Tusseau" gallery) where you can
find many funny examples of decorated potatoes. Of course, you can send your own creations
to the programmer,

will include them in the museum if he gets some spare time.
