<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 For graphists</A>
</H3>

<P>KTuberling allows many changes in the graphical appearance: the gamebard's size and shape, the number of
objects that can be moved onto it, their size and the category they belong to can be redefined. But
the labels of the various groups of objects (noses, eyes, goodies...) can't be changed. Neither can the
sounds associated to objects be changed.
<P>The pictures are located in the 'pics' directory. There are two pictures, named
'gameboard.xpm' and the other one 'masks.xpm'. The first one holds the gameboard
and the grid where the user can pick objects. The second one contains the masks of those pictures,
used to delimitate their borders and, sometimes, to give them some transparency (spectacles).
There is also a text file in this directory, named 'layout.txt'. One can find there - and change -
all information related to the positions of the pictures and masks of objects, define new objects,
and assign sounds to objects. The program needs not beeing recompiled when changing the number
and position of objects.
<P>Here comes the structure of layout.txt. It only contains integer numbers in decimal form,
separated by whitespace, and followed by comments. The comments are ignored.
<P>The first line describes the area (gameboard) where objects can be dropped to.
The first four numbers indicate the position of the 'landing area' (left, top, right, bottom),
whereas the fifth number indicates the sound associated with it (defined in source file
'categories.h').
<P>The second line indicates the number of texts that follow on the next lines.
Those texts cannot be modified, but they can be drawn somewhere else on the gameboard.
<P>The next lines describe the position of the texts describing the categories of objects, one text per line.
The first four numbers indicate the position of the text (left, top, right, bottom),
whereas the fifth number indicates the number of the text to draw (defined in source file
'categories.h').
<P>Then comes the number of objects described in the next lines.
Change this number if you want to add or remove objects.
<P>The last lines describe the position of the pictures (in 'gameboard.xpm') and masks (in 'masks.xpm')
of the objects, and the sound associated with them. The first four numbers are the coordinates of
the rectangle (left, top, bottom, right) of the picture, the next four one are the coordinates of
the rectangle (same order) of the mask, and the last one is the sound number (defined in source file
'categories.h').  Several objects can be associated with the same sound.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 For translators</A>
</H3>

<P>Besides the usual .po files mechanism, translators have to know that the sounds can be localized too.
If the various translators have recording devices, they can register their voice and store it into .wav
files in a new subdirectory of the sounds directory. Then they can translate the sound file name in the
.po file.
<P>For example, if destination language is italian, translators can register their voice in .wav files located
in /opt/kde/share/apps/ktuberling/sounds/it. Then they can translate file names like "en/hat.wav" to
names like "it/capello.wav".
<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 For programmers</A>
</H3>

<P>KTuberling isn't really difficult to extend for programmers.

<H4>.tuberling files structure</H4>

<P>A .tuberling file holds all the necessary data to redraw a tuberling.
It can be edited with an ordinary text editor.
<P>There is one graphical object per line, in the order that is used to draw them.
Each line contains 5 numbers: the identifier of the object, and the rectangle where it should be drawn
(left, top, right, bottom). The numbers are separated by whitespaces.
