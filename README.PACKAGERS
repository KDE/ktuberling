KTuberling a simple constructor game suitable for children and adults alike. The idea of the game is based around a once popular doll making concept.
It is aÂ "potato editor". That means that you can drag and drop eyes, mouths, mustache, and other parts of face and goodies onto a potato-like guy. Similarly, you have other playgrounds with different themes.
There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the funniest faces you can.
