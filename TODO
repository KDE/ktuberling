- Better format for .tuberling files (object names instead of numbers, XML?)

- Ability to choose other gameboards (for example : farm with animals, ocean with fishes, clown with accessories, etc)

- Write title of tuberling last opened / saved on top of the window

============== things for which I need help from other people : ==================

- French sounds

- Better graphics with colorized gameboard and objects

- Testing of clipboard, printing and sounds on other machines. You always have surprises
