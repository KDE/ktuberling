- Allow point and click instead of drag and drop (KDE bug #68779)

- Better format for .tuberling files (object names instead of numbers, XML)

- Split layout.xml in two parts : layout and sounds. The sounds.xml part would
  be distributed in the ktuberling-sounds package

- Draw a small hand when grabbing objects

- Write title of tuberling last opened / saved on top of the window

- Choose the current language accordingly to locale settings

- Add a "man" page for KTuberling

- See what's wrong with wide cursors on old Tektronix X terminals and if
  there's a workaround (KDE bug #68786)

============= Things for which I need help from other people : ================

                Iguana (the animal) 
                Boy-Barbie 
                Girl-Barbie 
                Money (different kind of)
