- Allow point and click instead of drag and drop (KDE bug #68779)

- Better format for .tuberling files (object names instead of numbers, XML)

- Split layout.xml in two parts : layout and sounds. The sounds.xml part would
  be distributed in the ktuberling-sounds package

- Draw a small hand when grabbing objects

- Write title of tuberling last opened / saved on top of the window

- Choose the current language accordingly to locale settings

- Add a "man" page for KTuberling

- See what's wrong with wide cursors on old Tektronix X terminals and if
  there's a workaround (KDE bug #68786)

============= Things for which I need help from other people : ================

- More and better localized sounds (German, Spanish, etc)

- More and better colour gameboards and objects (KDE bug #63211)
  For example : Clown with accessories
                Dragon 
                Boy-Barbie 
                Girl-Barbie 
                House 
                Compound animal

- Sounds in OGG Vorbis format (KDE bug #37251)

- Text above, not below images (KDE bug #53402)

- Vectorial pictures ? (to adapt to screen size)
