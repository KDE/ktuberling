- Better format for .tuberling files (object names instead of numbers)

- Ability to choose other gameboards (for example : farm with animals)

- Draw a small hand when grabbing objects

- Write title of tuberling last opened / saved on top of the window

============== things for which I need help from other people : ==================

- In the doc, I say that a few things don't work
  (copy image to clipboard, printer selection fuction)
  Maybe it works now with Qt 2.0 ?

- Have the doc proofread once again

- French sounds

- Colorized gameboard and objects
