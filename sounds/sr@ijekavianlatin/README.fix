These are the repaired audio files in Serbian language for KTuberling.

These files were repaired using Audacity 1.3.2-4 (Portaudio V19) and libresample.

In accordance with the new versions under KDE 4, speech files are generated in Ogg Vorbis and WAV formats.

If you encounter any issues, please contact the preparer (Thor Malmjursson) via the kde-games-devel mailing list (ThunderGod) or via email at:
